-- 3 results returned: Ruth, Eugene, Raymond.
-- 161 | Ruth |  Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away.
-- If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.
-- 162 | Eugene | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse,
-- I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- 163 | Raymond | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
-- I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
-- The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
